# API Integration Project

### Introduction
This project focuses on working with APIs to create a web application that provides real-time weather information, geolocation mapping, and additional functionalities through integration with multiple APIs. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in API usage, project organization, and design principles.

### Group Information
Name: Izotova Tatyana
Group Number: SE-2212

### Project Requirements
#### Core Requirements
1. Weather Information
Utilize the OpenWeatherAPI to display real-time weather data.
Include the following information:
Temperature
Description
Icon
Coordinates
Feels-like temperature
Humidity
Pressure
Wind speed
Country code
Rain volume for the last 3 hours

3. Geolocation and Mapping
Implement maps to visually represent the location of cities based on latitude and longitude.
Ensure that the logic for this functionality is implemented within the core JavaScript file, not in the HTML file.

#### Two Additional APIs
Integrate two extra APIs, distinct from OpenWeather, to enhance the application's functionality.
Ensure that these APIs run on the server side and provide valuable data to users.
Display the data retrieved from these APIs in the frontend part of your application.
Provide comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions, API usage details, and explanations of key design decisions in your Readme.md.
Implement the logic for these functionalities within the core JavaScript file.

#### Project Organization and Design
Keep code clean, well-documented, and organized.
Follow best practices for coding and maintain a clear project structure, building upon what was learned in previous assignments.
Responsive Design and User Interface
Implement a responsive design using media queries and CSS frameworks for optimal user experience across various devices.
Enhance the user interface with thoughtful design elements to make the application visually appealing.
Server Configuration and Dependencies
The server should run on port 3000.
Include a package.json file with all dependencies listed for easy setup.

### Instructions for Running the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the server with npm start.
Access the application through your browser at http://localhost:3000.
